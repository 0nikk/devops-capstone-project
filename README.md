Customer Accounts Microservice - Capstone Project

This project showcases the development and deployment of a RESTful Customer Accounts microservice. It demonstrates a full software development lifecycle, incorporating Agile methodologies, Test-Driven Development (TDD), Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), containerization, and cloud-native deployment.
Key Features & Accomplishments:

    RESTful API Development: Built a functional microservice with standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for customer accounts.
    Agile Project Management: Utilized GitHub issues, user stories, and Kanban boards for iterative development and sprint planning.
    Test-Driven Development (TDD): Ensured code quality and robustness with comprehensive unit tests (nosetests) and high code coverage (target >95%).
    CI/CD Pipeline: Implemented automated build, test, and deployment workflows using GitHub Actions and Tekton.
    Security Implementation: Integrated security headers (Flask-Talisman) and CORS policies (Flask-CORS).
    Containerization: Packaged the application into a Docker image.
    Cloud-Native Deployment: Deployed the microservice to a Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster, including database integration (PostgreSQL).

Tech Stack:

    Backend: Python, Flask
    Testing: nosetests, coverage
    CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Tekton
    Containerization: Docker
    Orchestration: Kubernetes, OpenShift
    Database: PostgreSQL
    Code Quality: Flake8
    Version Control: Git, GitHub
    Security: Flask-Talisman, Flask-CORS
